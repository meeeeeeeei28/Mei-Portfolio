# Final Project: Part 3

## The Final Data Story
My topic is about the startup market.
The number of startups is increasing every year and attracting attention from all over the world. As it is becoming easier for more and more people to found their own businesses, there are more and more people who are thinking about starting a business or are interested in starting a business. I would like to talk about the potential startup market for these people.

Here is my final data story(shorthand). Please click this link to see it.＊＊＊＊NEED to UPDATE

## Target Audience
My target audience is people who are interested in starting their own businesses and interested in startups.
After part2's user research, I had an opportunity to speak with an entrepreneur. He said this story was interesting and he wanted to know more details about benefit for entrepreneurs to start their businessesn in Estonia.
Therefore, I researched more details about it, and updated my final story.
