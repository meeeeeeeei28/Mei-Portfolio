# Final Project: Part 3

## The Final Data Story
My topic is about the startup market.
The number of startups is increasing every year and attracting attention from all over the world. As it is becoming easier for more and more people to found their own businesses, there are more and more people who are thinking about starting a business or are interested in starting a business. I would like to talk about the potential startup market for these people.

Here is my final data story(shorthand). Please click [this link](https://preview.shorthand.com/2YqEOTEyR2F8gui4) to see it.
For the reference, [this](https://preview.shorthand.com/y37hhJwUo7b19yGp) is a link for 1-min pitch.

## Target Audience
My target audience is people who are interested in starting their own businesses and interested in startups.
After part2's user research, I had an opportunity to speak with an entrepreneur. He said this story was interesting and he wanted to know more details about benefit for entrepreneurs to start their businessesn in Estonia.
Therefore, I researched more details about it, and updated my final story.

## Changes Made from Part 2

| Research synthesis | Plan for Part III | Design decisions that I did in Part III |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Chart's size and animation | I'm going to make bar chart and treemap smaller. Also I will make text bigger in those charts so that the audience can read easily. | After experimenting different ways to display the treemap, I decided to keep the original one since it is the best way to show it. When I used an image, I couldn't show all the labels and numbers of each country. However, as long as I embed the Tableau, audience can see details when they hover their cursor. In addition to that, I updated a top30 countries' charts from table to slope chart. The in-class exercise gave me a great hint to do that. While we were practicing to use RawGraphs, I found a slope chart option in it, and I thought it would be a great type of chart for the data. At the end of the day, I used Excel to create the slope chart, but it was a great practice and I really appreciate the opportunity. |
| Add more explanation and details | I should add a little bit more description about each chart as well as introduction, conclusion, and connect sentences so that readers can understnad this article without any additional explanation. | I added some introdution paragraphs at the beginning of the article as well as the transition between sctions so that audience can follow the story easily. Also, I added one section after the ranking of emerging market to explain how the scores were calculated.|
| Call-to-action | I'm still debating what kind of call-to-action is appropriate, but I feel like I should focus on only one button to eliminate any confusion. Considering the feedback and my storyline, I'm thinking to keep "Learn more about Estonia Startup Visa" button as a call-to-action or create new one. | I conducted 2 more interviews after finishing part2 and I asked their opinions specifically on call to action buttons. As I mentioned in the Part2 page, they said two buttons were a bit coufusing because those buttons seemed to target different group of audience. That makes sence. Considering the feedback and my thoughts that I had in Part2, I decided to keep only one of them to eliminate any confusion. |
| Simple language for reasons why Estonia attracts startups | Using bulled points or numbers, I would like to make them stand out. Also, I should change the expressions of them so that the target audience can understand the pros of Estonia. | As I noted in the previous section, an entrepreneur with whom I talked said that he was very curious the reason why Estonia is an emerging country for startups. Thus I researched more details about it, and revised the reasons to make it clear and used more smiple lannguages. In addition to the additional interview, the process of thinkng about the story for 1-min presentation helped me to structure the part. |
| Update images | Since I kept some icons of templates for this part 2, I'm going to replace them with proper icons or images. | As a first step, I changed some icons that I used the same ones as template. Since my shorthand uses black, white, and blue as key colors, I chose the images include them. After the last week's class, I realized the importance of copywrite of images, so I used unsplash's images as many as possible to eliminate my extra effort to add citation. |

## Final Thoughts
Looking back on the final project, the most hardest part was a Part1, That's because finding the data source as well as making a story with those data was really challenging for me. But at the same time, I really enjoyed it and I think the whole process was a great excecise for me since in a professional world the I can easily imagine that the similar situation would happen to me many times.
I appreciate this opportunity. In addition to that, shorthand was a very interesting and powerful tool in terms of making article within a limited time. I added it to my toolbox so that I'll be able to use it when necessary.
