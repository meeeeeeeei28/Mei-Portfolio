# About me
Hi, my name is Mei. I'm a graduate student studying Product Design and will graduate this December.

<img src="Profile-photo.JPG" width="200"/>

Before I enrolled at CMU, I worked as a B2B sales, consultant, and strategist to solve various companies' business problems.
I'm seeking full-time opportunities such as Product Designer, UX Designer, and Design Strategist where I can utilize my strategic thinking and UX design skills.


# What I hope to learn
I would like to learn how to choose an effective type of visualization considering the data and story that I want to tell to the audience.
Also, I'd like to practice design critique because it is a very good way to develop the ability to evaluate designs with reasoning in addition to improving my own designs.

Here's where all my projects will go.
