Before I enrolled CMU, I worked as a B2B sales, consultant, and strategist to solve various companies' business problems.
I'm seeking the full-time opportnity such as Product Designer, UX Designer, and Design Strategis where I can utilize my strategic thinking and UX design skills.


# What I hope to learn
I would like to learn how to choose an effective type of visualization considering the data and story that I want to tell to the audience.
Also, I'd like to practice design critique because it is a very good way to develop the ability to evaluate designs with reasoning in addition to improving my own designs.

Here's where all my projects will go.
