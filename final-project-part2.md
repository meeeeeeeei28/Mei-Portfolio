*Since I was not able to publish it (the error message showed up), I'm using a review link. There is a chance that some of changes I mention about in the last section will be already done when you review it.

## User Research

Although my main target audience is people who are considering starting a business, it's hard to find them, I counduct interviews with people who are interested in startups.

### Interviewee
#1: Office worker, late 20s

#2: Student, Early 20s

#3: Student, Easly 30s

### Interview Script and Notes

| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 | Interview 3|
| -------- | ----------- | ----------- | -----------|
| What's your takeaway from it? | There are many potential areas that businesses should know when it comes to starting a new businesses | Estonia is a new and emerging market for startups | _"If I want to create my own startup, I should look into Estonia as a first option."_ |
| What do you think about the storyboard? and Why? | _"I really like the animation and title of this. Animation's speed is not consistent. The bar chart looks powerpoint-ish, that could be done in a better way. I like how you transitioned to Estonia after identifying the reagion. "_| _"Your story is solid and interesting, and the this article looks nice and professional."_ | _"Interesting. Since I don't know much about Estonia, it was surprising me."_ |
| Who do you think is the intended audience for this? | Business people, people who are interested in startups| People who are interested in establishing their own companies or investors? | people who are generally interested in startups and their trends. Could be college students and business people. |
| Is there anything you find surprising or confusing? and Why? | _"I needed to know more details about each section to answer. I was curious about details. I'm a bit coufused about the buttons. Which one am I supposed to click?"_ | _"I just looked thorugh it, but I think some charts are too big or too small, and that was a bit annoying because I needed to pay extra attention to them."_ | _"One of the chart was too big to display a screen, it was hard to tell what you were trying to say. I like the buttons at the end of this. If there was only one option of "Catch up Startup latest News", I don't think I would click it."_ |
| What would you wish to know more? |_ "I want to know the content of placeholder text."_ | curious about some established startups in Estonia to get a better sense of how Estonia is a great market for startups. | _"I'm honestly not sure...but I think you can explain the reasons why Estonia is a great place for startups with an easy language."_ |


### Findings and Next Steps

I think the storyline itself sounds good and clear to the audience based on the feedback from interviews.
However, there are some necessary tweak and improvements. Details are below.

| Research synthesis | Anticipated changes for Part III |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Chart's size and animation | I'm going to make bar chart and treemap smaller. Also I will make text bigger in those charts so that the audience can read easily. |
| Add more explanation and details | I should add a little bit more description about each chart as well as introduction, conclusion, and connect sentences so that readers can understnad this article without any additional explanation. |
| Call-to-action | I'm still debating what kind of call-to-action is appropriate, but I feel like I should focus on only one button to eliminate any confusion. Considering the feedback and my storyline, I'm thinking to keep "Learn more about Estonia Startup Visa" button as a call-to-action or create new one. |
| Simple language for reasons why Estonia attracts startups | Using bulled points or numbers, I would like to make them stand out. Also, I should change the expressions of them so that the target audience can understand the pros of Estonia. |
| Update images | Since I kept some icons of templates for this part 2, I'm going to replace them with proper icons or images. |
